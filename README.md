Overview:
This Python-based tool offers a comprehensive computation process of depth inversion algorithm tailored for the study "Determining Optimal Window Size and Correcting for Wave Nonlinearity in Depth Inversion Algorithm" co-authored by Byunguk Kim. Utilizing Fourier transforms, empirical orthogonal function (EOF), and optimization, it enables precise analysis of evaluating depth inversion accuracy over various bathymetry with varying interrogation window sizes.

Features:
Data Processing: Supports diverse data formats with preprocessing capabilities.
Spectral and Spatial Analysis: Uses Fourier analysis and EOF to identify dominant wave components and spatial patterns.
Bathymetry Estimation: Employs a optimization approach to accurately estimate wave number and corresponding bathymetry from wave data. Here, the required optimization scheme can be install from DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.819853, but can be replaced to other methods.
Visualization and Export: Provides tools for data visualization and results exportation for further analysis or reporting.

Usage:
Designed for ease of use within a Python environment, it comes with documentation and examples for quick start. The example dataset can be found at DOI: 10.17632/h8b3427s8k.1

Support:
Open for community contributions and offers support through documentation and a dedicated team for queries and suggestions.
