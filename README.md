Overview:

This Python-based tool is designed specifically for the study "Determining Optimal Window Size and Correcting for Wave Nonlinearity in Depth Inversion Algorithms," co-authored by Byunguk Kim. It integrates advanced computational processes, including Fourier transforms, empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), and optimization techniques, to facilitate the precise evaluation of depth inversion accuracy across various bathymetries with different interrogation window sizes.

Features:

Data Processing: Offers support for a wide range of data formats, complete with preprocessing capabilities to prepare the data for analysis.

Spectral and Spatial Analysis: Utilizes Fourier analysis and EOF to extract dominant wave components and spatial patterns, crucial for understanding wave dynamics.

Bathymetry Estimation: Implements an optimization approach for accurate wave number estimation and corresponding bathymetry from wave data. The optimization scheme, which is central to this process, is available for installation from DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.819853 and can be substituted with alternative methods as required.

Visualization and Export: Equipped with visualization tools for in-depth data analysis and features to export results for further analysis or reporting.

Usage:

Crafted for straightforward use in a Python environment, this tool includes comprehensive documentation and examples to ensure a quick start. An example dataset is accessible via DOI: 10.17632/h8b3427s8k.1, supporting the findings of the referred study.

Support:

The project welcomes community contributions, offering extensive documentation and a dedicated support team to assist with inquiries and suggestions.
